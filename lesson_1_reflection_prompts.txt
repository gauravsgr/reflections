	the changes and also there would be fewer versions as compared to Google docs.
	The Cons might be that you need to be really cautious of when you think a change 
	is big enough to be put into a comit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they are made for the code developemnt which involve colaboration 
	of multiple developers

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    the git log will give you the history of all the versions aand the git diff will 
	give you the difference in the two versions by date, +, - and message

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since I have always the power to go back to the older working changes I need not worry about exploring 
	and experimenting with the files and codes
